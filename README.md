# Attendance-Tracker
The Smart Attendance Tracker is a Python-based desktop application built using Tkinter to manage and track student attendance for different subjects. It allows users to easily add subjects and students, mark attendance as Present or Absent, and automatically calculate attendance percentages. The app highlights students whose attendance falls below 75% in red. With a clean and intuitive user interface, this tool helps teachers or administrators efficiently manage and monitor student attendance across multiple subjects.
